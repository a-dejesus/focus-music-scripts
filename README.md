# focus-music-scripts
Bash scripts to remove vocals from music folders, creating lyric-free focus tracks â€” personal tools for distraction-free work.

This project started from a simple need: I wanted to listen to music without lyrics while working. These bash scripts process a folder of music to produce instrumental-only tracks, helping me maintain focus.
