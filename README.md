# focus-music-scripts
Bash scripts to remove vocals from music folders, creating lyric-free focus tracks — personal tools for distraction-free work.

This project started from a simple need: I wanted to listen to music without lyrics while working. These bash scripts process a folder of music to produce instrumental-only tracks, helping me maintain focus.

It’s a small project, but meaningful — it reflects problem-solving without emotional friction, just tinkering and making something useful for daily life.
